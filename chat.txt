The Winners is always part of the answer; 
The Loser is always part of the problem.

The winner is always has a program;
The Loser always has an excuse.

The winner says,'Let me do it for you';
The Loser says,'That is not my job.'

A winner makes commitments;
A Loser makes promises.

Winners say,'I must do something';
Losers say,'something must be done.'

Winners are a part of the team;
Losers are apart from the team.

Winners  see the gain;
Losers see the pain.
